# Pull Request Guidelines

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

In order to give everyone a chance to submit a pull request and contribute to Talawa project, we have put restrictions in place. This section outlines the guidelines that should be imposed upon pull requests at Talawa. 

1. Do not start working on any open issue and raise PR unless it is assigned to you.
2. Pull requests must be based on [open issues](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa/issues) available.
3. Each contributor may only create one pull request at a time. We have this rule in place due to our limited resources - if everyone was allowed to post multiple pull requests we will not be able to review them properly. It is also better for contibutors because you can focus on creating one quality PR - so spend time making sure it is as good as it can be.
4. If the pull request has serious issues, or would require a significant rewrite to be acceptable, we might close it and you will not be allowed to open a new one. So please be careful when posting a PR.
5. Ensure the PR title clearly describes the problem it is solving. Include the relevant issue number, observed behaviour, expected behaviour, snapshots and videos if possible.
6. No Work In Progress. ONLY completed and working pull requests, and with test units, will be accepted. A WIP would fall under rule 4 and be closed immediately.
7. Please do not @mention contributors and mentors. Sometimes it takes time before we can review your pull request or answer your questions but we'll get to it sooner or later. @mentioning someone just adds to the pile of notifications we get and it won't make us look at your issue faster.
8. Do not force push. If you make changes to your pull request, please simply add a new commit as that makes it easy for us to review your new changes. If you force push, we'll have to review everything from the beginning.
9. PR should be small, easy to review and should follow standard coding styles.
10. If PR has conflicts because of recently added changes to the same file, resolve issues, test new changes and submit PR again for review.
11. Finally, PRs should be atomic. That is, they should address one item (issue or feature)
12. After submitting PR, if you are not replying within 48 hours then in that case we may need to assign issue to other contributors based on priority of the issue.
